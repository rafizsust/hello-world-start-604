TASK 1 SPECIFIC BAND DESCRIPTORS:

TASK ACHIEVEMENT (assess how well the task requirements are fulfilled):
- Band 9: Fully satisfies all requirements; clearly presents a fully developed response with relevant, extended and well-supported ideas
- Band 8: Sufficiently addresses all parts of the task; presents a well-developed response with relevant, extended and supported ideas
- Band 7: Addresses all parts of the task; presents a clear overview with appropriately highlighted key features/bullet points
- Band 6: Addresses the requirements of the task; presents an overview with some key features highlighted
- Band 5: Generally addresses the task; format may be inappropriate in places; recounts detail mechanically
- Band 4: Attempts to address the task but does not cover all key features; format may be inappropriate
- Band 3: Does not adequately address the task; no clear overview; key features largely irrelevant

COHERENCE AND COHESION (assess organization and logical flow):
- Band 9: Uses cohesion in such a way that it attracts no attention; skilfully manages paragraphing
- Band 8: Sequences information and ideas logically; manages all aspects of cohesion well; uses paragraphing sufficiently and appropriately
- Band 7: Logically organises information and ideas; clear progression throughout; uses a range of cohesive devices appropriately
- Band 6: Arranges information and ideas coherently; uses cohesive devices effectively, but cohesion within sentences may be faulty
- Band 5: Presents information with some organisation but no overall progression; inadequate or overused cohesive devices
- Band 4: Presents information and ideas but not arranged coherently; uses some basic cohesive devices
- Band 3: Does not organise ideas logically; very limited use of cohesive devices

LEXICAL RESOURCE (assess vocabulary range and accuracy):
- Band 9: Uses a wide range of vocabulary with very natural and sophisticated control of lexical features
- Band 8: Uses a wide range of vocabulary fluently and flexibly; skilfully uses uncommon lexical items
- Band 7: Uses a sufficient range of vocabulary to allow some flexibility and precision; uses less common lexical items with some awareness of style
- Band 6: Uses an adequate range of vocabulary for the task; attempts to use less common vocabulary with some inaccuracy
- Band 5: Uses a limited range of vocabulary; may make noticeable errors in spelling and word formation
- Band 4: Uses only basic vocabulary; makes numerous errors in spelling and word formation
- Band 3: Uses only a very limited range of words and expressions; errors in word formation are frequent

GRAMMATICAL RANGE AND ACCURACY (assess sentence structures and error frequency):
- Band 9: Uses a wide range of structures with full flexibility and accuracy; rare minor errors occur only as slips
- Band 8: Uses a wide range of structures; the majority of sentences are error-free; makes only very occasional errors
- Band 7: Uses a variety of complex structures; produces frequent error-free sentences; has good control of grammar and punctuation
- Band 6: Uses a mix of simple and complex sentence forms; makes some errors in grammar and punctuation
- Band 5: Uses only a limited range of structures; attempts complex sentences but with limited accuracy
- Band 4: Uses only a very limited range of structures; rare use of subordinate clauses; errors predominate
- Band 3: Attempts sentence forms but errors in grammar and punctuation predominate`;

- Band 7: Addresses all parts of the task; presents a clear position throughout the response; presents, extends and supports main ideas
- Band 6: Addresses all parts of the task although some parts may be more fully covered than others; presents a relevant position
- Band 5: Addresses the task only partially; the format may be inappropriate in places; expresses a position but development is not always clear
- Band 4: Responds to the task only in a minimal way; the format may be inappropriate; position may be unclear
- Band 3: Does not adequately address any part of the task; does not express a clear position

COHERENCE AND COHESION (assess organization and logical flow):

${isTask1 ? task1Criteria : task2Criteria}

CRITICAL SCORING GUIDELINES:
1. Score each criterion INDEPENDENTLY based on the specific evidence you observe
2. Each criterion measures DIFFERENT skills - a candidate may excel in vocabulary but struggle with grammar
3. Use half-band scores (5.5, 6.5, 7.5) when performance falls between bands
4. Justify each score with specific examples from the text
5. Calculate overall band as the arithmetic mean of all four criteria (rounded to nearest 0.5)
6. Be strict but fair - real IELTS examiners rarely give 8+ bands
7. Address the candidate directly using "you" and "your" in feedback

IMPORTANT DIFFERENTIATION:
- A candidate with excellent vocabulary but poor grammar should show DIFFERENT scores for those criteria
- A well-organized essay with limited vocabulary should score HIGH on coherence but LOWER on lexical resource
- Consider each criterion in isolation based ONLY on evidence relevant to that skill
